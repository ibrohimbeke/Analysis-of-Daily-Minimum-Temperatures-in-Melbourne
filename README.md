# Analysis-of-Daily-Minimum-Temperatures-in-Melbourne
Using this dataset, the analysis will focus on identifying trends, seasonal patterns, and making future temperature predictions. The project will employ statistical methods and advanced machine learning techniques, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to enhance the accuracy of predictive models.
